    title: A few things about me
    summary: |
      I spend my time learning stuff in the university, completing assignments and play games in my free time. As I am a fast learner, I like to learn new languages (both programming and physical ones). I don't have work experience yet in the science of informatics. I'm more of a lone wolf when it comes to projects, but I've been learning to work as a member in a team and co-operate with others for the past <script type="text/javascript">document.write( new Date().getFullYear() - 2019 );</script>  years.
